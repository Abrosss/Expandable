# OOP
In Object Oriented Programming we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit, which is called, an object. We refer to variables as properties and functions as methods. 
# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called an "object." The main idea behind encapsulation is to hide the internal details of how an object's data is structured and manipulated, and to provide a controlled interface for interacting with the object.
1. Data Hiding: The internal data of an object is hidden from outside access. It can only be accessed or modified through well-defined methods (getters and setters) provided by the object. This helps ensure that the data remains in a valid state and prevents unintended manipulation.
2. Abstraction: Encapsulation allows you to define a clear interface for interacting with an object. Users of the object don't need to know the internal implementation details; they can interact with the object using its methods.
# Abstraction
All complexity is hidden

# Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you eliminate redundant code. Methods are defined once and inherited.

# Polymorphism 
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
- We use one block of code and decide which version of the code we use depending on the input. 
- The ability to do a similar operation on the input, not considering its type.
- Polymorphism focuses on the ability of different classes to provide a common interface or behavior through method overriding.
