# Software Development Principles
Software development principles are fundamental guidelines and concepts that guide the design, development, and maintenance of high-quality software systems. </br> 
Here are some key software development principles:
1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): This principle encourages developers to avoid duplicating code. Instead, code should be modular and reusable, reducing redundancy and making maintenance easier.
2. SOLID Principles:
    - Single responsibility
    - open/closed principle. After code has been created and tested, keep it closed to modification, but open to extension.
    - Liskov Substitution Principle: objects of a subclass can replace objects of the superclass without undermining the system.
    - Interface segregation: every class must have an isolated interface of its own
    - Dependency inversion principle: high level modules should not be dependent on low level modules, and both should depend on abstractions. Abstrat interfaces should be more stable than details which are variables. 
3. Separation of Concerns: Each component or module should have a single responsibility. This principle enhances modularity and makes the codebase more maintainable.
4. Code Reusability: Code should be designed with reusability in mind, allowing components or functions to be easily used in different parts of the application.
5. Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before writing code helps ensure that the code functions as intended and remains reliable during changes.
6. Version Control and Collaboration: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage code history.
7. Documentation
8. Refactoring
9. Abstraction
10. Modularity
11. Data Protection
12. KISS (keep it simple stupid!). While this principle isnâ€™t limited to software design, it is still very important in this field. You should avoid complexity and write code that is easy to implement and maintain.
13. Avoid trying to reinvent the wheel
