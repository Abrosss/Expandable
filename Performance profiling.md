# Performance profiling
Performance profiling, also known as profiling, is the process of analyzing and measuring the runtime behavior and performance characteristics of a software application. The goal of performance profiling is to identify performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, inefficient code, and other areas that might negatively impact the application's performance, responsiveness, and resource utilization.

Profiling involves collecting various metrics and data about an application's execution, including:
1. Execution Time
2. Memory Usage
3. CPU Usage
4. Method Calls
5. Network Activity

   Profiling in JS:
   1. Browser Developer Tools
   2. Performance.now() . This method returns a high-resolution time value that can be used to measure the duration of specific code blocks. 
   3. JavaScript Profiling Libraries
   When profiling JavaScript, it's important to consider both the client-side (browser) and server-side (Node.js) environments, as well as different aspects like CPU usage, memory usage, and network activity. Profiling tools can help identify areas for optimization, allowing developers to improve the performance of their JavaScript applications.
