# Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is a design pattern used in software development to achieve a loosely coupled architecture by allowing components to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. </br>
In DI, instead of a component creating its own dependencies directly, those dependencies are provided (injected) from the outside. This makes the code more flexible, easier to test, and less tightly coupled, as components don't need to know the details of how their dependencies are created or managed.

# Inversion of control
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a software design principle that promotes the inversion of the traditional flow of control in a software application. 
In a traditional application, the main program controls the flow of execution and manages the creation and invocation of various components. In contrast, IoC shifts the responsibility of managing components and their interactions to a container or framework, often referred to as the IoC container.
In other words, with IoC, the control over how components are created, configured, and connected is handed over to an external container, rather than being managed directly by the components themselves or the main application. </br>
Key concepts and benefits of Inversion of Control include:
1. Separation of Concerns: IoC encourages a clear separation between the application's core logic and the management of dependencies. This makes the codebase more modular and easier to understand.
2. Loose Coupling: By relying on an IoC container to manage dependencies, components become more loosely coupled. Components don't need to know how their dependencies are created or wired together.
3. Ease of Testing: Components can be tested in isolation by providing mock or stub dependencies. This makes unit testing more effective and reliable.
4. Flexibility: IoC allows you to change the configuration and behavior of the application without modifying the code of individual components. This is particularly useful when dealing with different deployment environments or changing requirements.
5. Reusability: Components can be designed to be more reusable since they don't carry the responsibility of creating and managing their dependencies.
6. IoC is closely related to the Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern. Dependency Injection is a common way to achieve Inversion of Control. When using DI, the dependencies of a component are injected from the outside, typically by an IoC container.

IoC containers, like Spring Framework for Java or Angular for TypeScript, manage the lifecycle of components, handle their creation and initialization, and resolve dependencies automatically.

Overall, Inversion of Control helps build more modular, maintainable, and flexible software systems by abstracting the management of components' lifecycles and interactions.

# Concurrency design patterns
concurrency patterns are those types of design patterns that deal with the multi-threaded programming paradigm. </br>
Concurrency design patterns are a set of reusable solutions and best practices used in software development to manage and address challenges related to concurrent and parallel programming. Concurrency involves the execution of multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, while parallelism involves the actual execution of those tasks on multiple processors or cores. </br>
