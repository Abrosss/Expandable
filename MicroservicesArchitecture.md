# Microservices architecture
Microservices architecture is an architectural style for designing and building software applications as a collection of small, independent, coupled services that work together to form a complete application. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, typically over a network.
Key characteristics of microservices architecture include:
1. Modularity: Applications are divided into small, focused services, each addressing a specific business function.
2. Independence: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled and tested separately, enabling teams to work in parallel and adopt different technologies if needed.
3. Flexibility: Since services are separate, it's easier to update or replace specific services without affecting the entire application.
4. Scalability: Microservices allow you to scale individual services based on demand. This ensures efficient resource utilization and responsiveness.
5. Polyglot Programming: Different services can be developed using different programming languages or technologies that best suit their requirements.
6. Resilience: If one service fails, it doesn't necessarily affect the entire application. Failures are isolated to the specific service.
