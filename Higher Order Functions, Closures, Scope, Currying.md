# Higher order functions
Higher order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter or returns a function.  In other words, a higher-order function is a function that operates on other functions â€“ either by taking them as arguments, returning them, or both.
Example: setTimeout() in JS or array.filter()
Without higher order functions there would be no map, filter, reduce and asyncronous operations

# Closures
Inner function has an access to variables outside of it in the outer function, even if the outer function finished executing </br>
A closure "captures" the environment in which it was created, including all the variables that were in scope at that time.</br>
Closures are useful in various scenarious:
- Data Encapsulation
- Function Factories
- Callback Functions
- Asyncronous JS

# Scope
Scope = context in which variables are accessed.
Scope = boundaries where a variable is valid.
Helps prevent naming conflicts

# Currying
