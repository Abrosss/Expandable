# API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different applications to communicate and interact with each other.
- API is about abstraction: there can be a lot of code behind but you get only data you need. 
- API is standartized. There are a few popular formats: SOAP, GraphQL, REST


# REST API
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. This is a type of API that is industry known and used
RESTful web service is a service that uses REST API to communicate
Statelessness, where each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. This is a key aspect of designing RESTful APIs.
Benefits: 
1. Simple and standartized approach to communication
2. Data is scalable and stateless
3. High performance and cache support

An API request is sent from the client to a server and a response is received back from the server usually in JSON format

CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
Equivalent HTTP Methods:
Create = Post
Read = Get
Update = Put
Delete = Delete

Request consists of:
1. Operation (HTTP methods)
2. Endpoint
3. Parameters/Body (data)
4. Headers (API key, authorization)

# SDK

SDK stands for Software Development Kit
Code that calls API for you
It enables you to use APIs easily without setting all the requests by yourself
