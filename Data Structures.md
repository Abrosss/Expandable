# Data Structures
Data structures are fundamental constructs used in computer science and programming to organize and store data in a way that enables efficient manipulation, retrieval, and management. 
</br>
Some common types of data structures include:
1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists. Linked lists consist of nodes, where each node holds data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are efficient for inserting and deleting elements, especially in the middle, but accessing elements requires traversal ( refers to the process of moving through the elements or nodes of the structure sequentially, one by one, linked lists do not offer direct random access like arrays, where you can access elements by their index).
3. Stacks. Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
4. Queues: Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
5. Trees. Trees are a way to organize things hierarchically, making them useful for things like organizing files on your computer, representing relationships in databases, or even figuring out the fastest way to search for something in computer programs.
6. Graphs. Graphs help us see how things are connected, help us understand relationships and navigate through information.
7. Hash Tables
8. Heaps. Heap  is like a special arrangement of data where each thing (let's call them "elements") has a value, and the elements are arranged so that the tallest or smallest element is always at the top. Heaps are used in computer programs when you need to quickly find the biggest or smallest value from a collection of data.
9. Tries. Tries are tree-like structures used for storing dynamic sets of strings. They are particularly efficient for searching and indexing.

#  Binary Search Tree
A Binary Search Tree is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data while maintaining a specific order among its elements. It's commonly used in computer science for various applications that involve searching and organizing data.

</br>
A binary search tree, or "ordered binary tree" is a type of binary tree where the nodes are arranged in order: for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the parent node, and all the elements in its right subtree are greater than the parent node.
</br>
They are used to implement dictionaries, implement multilevel indexing in DBs. as well as Implementing search algorithms.
