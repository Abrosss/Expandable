# Ternary expression

Ternary means 'consisting of three'. A ternary expression is an expression that takes three operands or arguments and it involves three components: the condition to be evaluated and two possible values to be returned based on the condition's evaluation (true or false). <br/>
Nesting should be avoided as well as conditions when no value is returned
