# Ternary expression

Ternary means 'consisting of three'. A ternary expression is an expression that takes three operands or arguments and it involves three components: the condition to be evaluated and two possible values to be returned based on the condition's evaluation (true or false). <br/>
Nesting should be avoided as well as conditions when no value is returned

# Destructuring
Destructuring in JavaScript is a feature that allows you to easily extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a concise and readable way. </br>
We place the element that we want to destructure on the right side of the expression </br>
[] on the left for arrays, the variables correspond to the position of an element in the array that is being destructured </br>
{} for objects
