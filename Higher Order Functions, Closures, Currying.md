# Higher order functions
Higher order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter or returns a function.  In other words, a higher-order function is a function that operates on other functions â€“ either by taking them as arguments, returning them, or both.
Example: setTimeout() in JS or array.filter()
Without higher order functions there would be no map, filter, reduce and asyncronous operations

# Closures
Inner function has an access to variables outside of it
